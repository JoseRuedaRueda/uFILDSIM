** 0.3 Namelist update:
- Default values are defined for namelist parameters, no need of giving all parameters like inputs
- GeomID changed to geomFolder: Now we would need to give the program the whole path to the folder with the element files and not just the geomID
- SINPA_dir changed to runFolder: Now instead the root directory of the SINPA code, the FORTRAN code need the folder containing the run (the parent folder for the inputs/results) This is included to gain flexibility with the SINPA execution to remap FILD frames
- Gyroradius and XI arrays are sorted in the FORTRAN code, such that there is no 'issues' with their reading in python

** 0.2 Backtracing:
- Included a flag to allow for backtracing in the namelist (the flag is called backtrace). The backtrace is just included reversing the sign of the time step in the integration
- Collimator factor definition now takes into account the restricted interval for launching the particles
